Docker microservice with python(flask) and mysql 

0] 
How to implement microservice  (CRUD Operation) : 
	We used Flask & mysql to implement this CRUD operations.We create database “myUsers” and create table “users”.  Our table user schema is:-

User Object 
{
	ID : Integer ,
	Name : Integer ,
	Age : Integer ,
	Department : String ,
	Subject : List 
}

We write 4 API’s in flask :
1) /add  :-  
	In this API , take input from json file and insert user data into our database.We insert a user when method is POST.

2) /users :- 
	In this API , we fetch all users data from database and display it. In this API Method is GET.

3) /update :-  
	In this API, we update user data. API take input from json file and update user where user   Id = %(ID) from our datebase ID . In this API method is PUT .

4) /delete/<int:ID> :-  http://localhost:8080/delete/ID
	In this API , we delete user from database. It takes user id from API and delete that user where user Id = %ID (which is from API). In this API method is DELETE . 



How to run the program :-
	Firstly install all dependencies and then run program.
sudo apt-get install mysql-server
sudo apt-get install mysql-client
pip3 install -r  app/requirements.txt
mysql -uroot -p < userDb.sql   

Run Program :- 
 	python3 app.py
	python3 config.py
	python3 main.py

How to build an micorservice image from our Dockerfile :- Extract my folder and run commands
	
	docker build  -t  myapp  . 
	docker run  -it  myapp

Go to postman and type http://127.0.0.1:5000  in the  address bar and see index page of our microservice app.


i) For Create user :-  
 	For create(insert) user data, type http://localhost:8080/add  and select method “POST”  , provide data with json file into body section and click send button in postman. So API insert user data in our database.

Json data :
{
    "ID": 18136,
    "Name": "Vicky Pardeshi",
    "Age": 23,
    "Department": "PUSCD",
    "Subject": "DevOps"
}


ii) For select (fetch all user or one user) :-
	For select all users then type  http://localhost:8080/users and select method “GET” in postman. So we get all users data.
	For select a user then type http://localhost:8080/user/ID and select method “GET” .So we get on user data.


iii) For update user :-
	For update user data, type  http://localhost:8080/update  and select method “PUT” , provide json file into body section and click send button in postman. So update user when id = ID

Json data : -
{
	"ID":18107,
	"Name":"Aniket Chavan",
	"Age":25,
	"Department":"PUCSD",
	"Subject":"OS"
}


iv) For delete user :-
	For delete a user, type http://localhost:8080/delete/ID  and select method “DELETE” in postman , so delete that user where user Id= ID (ID from API request).
